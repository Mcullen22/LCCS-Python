#lists are useful as they allow us to group many variables into one variable

boysNames = ['Adam', 'Brian', 'Conor']
#this is a list where all items are string

boysAges = [4,5,6]
#this list is all numbers

Other = ["2", 2]
#the first 2 is a string
#the second list item is a number

#SQUARE BRACKETS denote a list

#Lists are mutable, values can be added, taken away, deleted
